# skyshapython

**A Python library for utilities and wrappers for frequently used functionality.**

skyshapython is a lightweight and intuitive Python library designed to simplify common programming tasks. It currently includes easy-to-use wrappers for working with MaxHeap and MinHeap, extending Python's built-in functionality in a clean and efficient way. The library is licensed under the MIT license, ensuring it is free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

**Note** - As long as the library is in version `0.x.x` I am not actively looking after this. When I do intend to start managing and supporting this more seriously, I will upgrade to versions `1.0` and above. Thank you.

## Installation

You can install skyshapython directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install skyshapython
```

## Features

### **MaxHeap**
A simple wrapper for Python's `heapq` module, providing an easy-to-use MaxHeap implementation.

> Supports pushing single values or lists, and popping single or multiple values.

**Usage:**

```python
from skyshapython import MaxHeap

# Initialize the MaxHeap as default, with a value, or list
max_heap = MaxHeap() # default
max_heap_value = MaxHeap(5) # with a value
max_heap_list = MaxHeap([5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 9]) # with a list

# Add items to the heap
max_heap.push(10)
max_heap.push(20)
max_heap.push(5)

# Add multiple items at once
max_heap.push([50, 30, 40])

# Get the largest item
largest = max_heap.pop()
print(largest)  # Output: 50 (the largest value)

# Peek at the largest item without removing it
print(max_heap.peek())  # Output: 40 (the next largest)

# Add and pop in one operation (adding a single item)
max_heap.pushpop(15)  # Adds 15 and removes the largest element

# Add and pop multiple items in one operation
max_heap.pushpop([100, 200])  # Adds [100, 200], pops and returns the 2 largest values

# It can pop multiple items at once
max_heap.pop(2) # Outputs 2 largest values in order

# pop all remaining values in descending order
max_heap.popall()

# Check if the heap is empty
if max_heap:
    print("Heap is not empty")

# check length of the heap, number of values in it
print(len(max_heap))
```

### **MinHeap**
A clean wrapper for Python's `heapq` module, providing an intuitive MinHeap implementation.

> Supports pushing single values or lists, and popping single or multiple values.

**Usage:**

```python
from skyshapython import MinHeap

# Initialize the MinHeap as default, with a value, or list
min_heap = MinHeap() # default
min_heap_value = MinHeap(5) # with a value
min_heap_list = MinHeap([5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 9]) # with a list

# Add items to the heap
min_heap.push(10)
min_heap.push(20)
min_heap.push(5)

# Add multiple items at once
min_heap.push([50, 30, 40])

# Get the smallest item
smallest = min_heap.pop()
print(smallest)  # Output: 5 (the smallest value)

# Peek at the smallest item without removing it
print(min_heap.peek())  # Output: 10 (the next smallest)

# Add and pop in one operation (adding a single item)
min_heap.pushpop(15)  # Adds 15 and removes the smallest element

# Add and pop multiple items in one operation
min_heap.pushpop([100, 200])  # Adds [100, 200], pops and returns the 2 smallest values

# It can pop multiple items at once
min_heap.pop(2)  # Outputs 2 smallest values in order

# pop all remaining values in ascending order
min_heap.popall()

# Check if the heap is empty
if not min_heap:
    print("Heap is empty")

# Check length of the heap, number of values in it
print(len(min_heap))
```

**Note** - To be fair I do not know how often I will check back with this library and look through suggested pull requests as so on.. At the time of writing this up I just wanted to make heaps easier for myself (I detest the heapq syntax. It feels like such a chore & I often forget it). In the future, I may add mode functionality to this and change my approach toward this tiny library. But until then.. godspeed!

Happy coding with **skyshapython**! ðŸŽ‰
