# skyshapython

**A Python library for utilities and wrappers for frequently used functionality.**

skyshapython is a lightweight and intuitive Python library designed to simplify common programming tasks. It currently includes easy-to-use wrappers for working with MaxHeap and MinHeap, extending Python's built-in functionality in a clean and efficient way. The library is licensed under the MIT license, ensuring it is free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

## Installation

You can install skyshapython directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install skyshapython
```

## Features

### **MaxHeap**
A simple wrapper for Python's `heapq` module, providing an easy-to-use MaxHeap implementation.

**Usage:**

```python
from skyshapython import MaxHeap

# Initialize the MaxHeap
max_heap = MaxHeap()

# Add items to the heap
max_heap.push(10)
max_heap.push(20)
max_heap.push(5)

# Get the largest item
largest = max_heap.pop()
print(largest)  # Output: 20

# Peek at the largest item without removing it
print(max_heap.peek())  # Output: 10

# Add and pop in one operation
max_heap.pushpop(15)  # Adds 15 and removes the largest element
print(max_heap.pop())  # Output: 10

# Check if the heap is empty
if max_heap:
    print("Heap is not empty")
```

### **MinHeap**
A clean wrapper for Python's `heapq` module, providing an intuitive MinHeap implementation.

**Usage:**

```python
from skyshapython import MinHeap

# Initialize the MinHeap
min_heap = MinHeap()

# Add items to the heap
min_heap.push(10)
min_heap.push(20)
min_heap.push(5)

# Get the smallest item
smallest = min_heap.pop()
print(smallest)  # Output: 5

# Peek at the smallest item without removing it
print(min_heap.peek())  # Output: 10

# Add and pop in one operation
min_heap.pushpop(15)  # Adds 15 and removes the smallest element
print(min_heap.pop())  # Output: 15

# Check if the heap is empty
if not min_heap:
    print("Heap is empty")
```

**Note** - To be fair I do not know how often I will check back with this library and look through suggested pull requests as so on.. At the time of writing this up I just wanted to make heaps easier for myself (I detest the heapq syntax. It feels like such a chore & I often forget it). In the future, I may add mode functionality to this and change my approach toward this tiny library. But until then.. happy coding!

Happy coding with **skyshapython**! 🎉
