# skyshapython

**A Python library for utilities and wrappers for frequently used functionality.**

skyshapython is a lightweight and intuitive Python library designed to simplify common programming tasks. It currently includes easy-to-use wrappers for working with MaxHeap and MinHeap, extending Python's built-in functionality in a clean and efficient way. The library is licensed under the MIT license, ensuring it is free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.

## Features

### **MaxHeap**
A simple wrapper for Python's `heapq` module, providing an easy-to-use MaxHeap implementation.

> Supports pushing single values or lists, and popping single or multiple values.

**Usage:**

```python
from skyshapython import MaxHeap

# Initialize the MaxHeap as default, with a value, or list
max_heap = MaxHeap() # default
max_heap_value = MaxHeap(5) # with a value
max_heap_list = MaxHeap([5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 9]) # with a list

# Add items to the heap
max_heap.push(10)
max_heap.push(20)
max_heap.push(5)

# Add multiple items at once
max_heap.push([50, 30, 40])

# Get the largest item
largest = max_heap.pop()
print(largest)  # Output: 50 (the largest value)

# Peek at the largest item without removing it
print(max_heap.peek())  # Output: 40 (the next largest)

# Add and pop in one operation (adding a single item)
max_heap.pushpop(15)  # Adds 15 and removes the largest element

# Add and pop multiple items in one operation
max_heap.pushpop([100, 200])  # Adds [100, 200], pops and returns the 2 largest values

# It can pop multiple items at once
max_heap.pop(2) # Outputs 2 largest values in order

# pop all remaining values in descending order
max_heap.popall()

# Check if the heap is empty
if max_heap:
    print("Heap is not empty")

# check length of the heap, number of values in it
print(len(max_heap))
```

### **MinHeap**
A clean wrapper for Python's `heapq` module, providing an intuitive MinHeap implementation.

> Supports pushing single values or lists, and popping single or multiple values.

**Usage:**

```python
from skyshapython import MinHeap

# Initialize the MinHeap as default, with a value, or list
min_heap = MinHeap() # default
min_heap_value = MinHeap(5) # with a value
min_heap_list = MinHeap([5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 9]) # with a list

# Add items to the heap
min_heap.push(10)
min_heap.push(20)
min_heap.push(5)

# Add multiple items at once
min_heap.push([50, 30, 40])

# Get the smallest item
smallest = min_heap.pop()
print(smallest)  # Output: 5 (the smallest value)

# Peek at the smallest item without removing it
print(min_heap.peek())  # Output: 10 (the next smallest)

# Add and pop in one operation (adding a single item)
min_heap.pushpop(15)  # Adds 15 and removes the smallest element

# Add and pop multiple items in one operation
min_heap.pushpop([100, 200])  # Adds [100, 200], pops and returns the 2 smallest values

# It can pop multiple items at once
min_heap.pop(2)  # Outputs 2 smallest values in order

# pop all remaining values in ascending order
min_heap.popall()

# Check if the heap is empty
if not min_heap:
    print("Heap is empty")

# Check length of the heap, number of values in it
print(len(min_heap))
```

### **SortMaster**
A versatile class that provides a variety of sorting algorithms, including basic sorting techniques as well as multi-threaded and optimized approaches.

> Supports sorting using algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, Timsort, IntroSort, and even a custom multi-threaded sorting implementation.

Sorting Methods:
- Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- Selection Sort: A comparison-based sorting method that repeatedly selects the smallest element.
- Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm, often the fastest for large datasets.
- Merge Sort: A stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm using the divide-and-conquer approach.
- Insertion Sort: A comparison-based sorting method that builds the sorted list one element at a time.
- Heap Sort: A comparison-based sorting algorithm based on binary heaps.
- Timsort:  A hybrid sorting algorithm derived from MergeSort and InsertionSort, used in Python's built-in sorting.
- Intro Soft: A hybrid sorting algorithm combining QuickSort, HeapSort, and InsertionSort.
- Thread Sort: A multi-threaded sorting algorithm that uses multiple threads to speed up sorting on large datasets. (custom sorting solution)

Amusing Methods:
- Sleep Sort: A quirky and inefficient sorting algorithm that "sleeps" for a duration proportional to each numberâ€™s value and outputs them in order of completion.
- Bogosort: A highly inefficient and random sorting algorithm that repeatedly shuffles the list until it happens to be sorted.

> I cannot recommend the 'amusing' sorting methods. They can work, but they are very inefficient. The inspiration behind them was simply 'because I can'.

**Usage:**

```python
from skyshapython import SortMaster

# Initialize the SortMaster instance
sort_master = SortMaster()

# Sorting with BubbleSort (ascending and descending order)
arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
sorted_asc = sort_master.bubble_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=False)
sorted_desc = sort_master.bubble_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=True)

print(sorted_asc)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
print(sorted_desc)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]

# Sorting with SelectionSort (ascending and descending order)
sorted_asc = sort_master.selection_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=False)
sorted_desc = sort_master.selection_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=True)

print(sorted_asc)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
print(sorted_desc)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]

# Sorting with QuickSort
sorted_asc = sort_master.quick_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=False)
sorted_desc = sort_master.quick_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=True)

print(sorted_asc)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
print(sorted_desc)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]

# Sorting with MergeSort
sorted_asc = sort_master.merge_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=False)
sorted_desc = sort_master.merge_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=True)

print(sorted_asc)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
print(sorted_desc)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]

# Sorting with InsertionSort
sorted_asc = sort_master.insertion_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=False)
sorted_desc = sort_master.insertion_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=True)

print(sorted_asc)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
print(sorted_desc)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]

# Sorting with HeapSort
sorted_asc = sort_master.heap_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=False)
sorted_desc = sort_master.heap_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=True)

print(sorted_asc)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
print(sorted_desc)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]

# Sorting with Timsort
sorted_asc = sort_master.timsort(arr.copy(), reverse=False)
sorted_desc = sort_master.timsort(arr.copy(), reverse=True)

print(sorted_asc)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
print(sorted_desc)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]

# Sorting with IntroSort
sorted_asc = sort_master.introsort(arr.copy(), reverse=False)
sorted_desc = sort_master.introsort(arr.copy(), reverse=True)

print(sorted_asc)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
print(sorted_desc)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]

# Sorting with ThreadSort (multi-threaded sorting)
sorted_asc = sort_master.thread_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=False)
sorted_desc = sort_master.thread_sort(arr.copy(), reverse=True)

print(sorted_asc)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
print(sorted_desc)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]

# Finding the fastest sorting algorithm
fastest_algo = sort_master.fastest(arr.copy(), reverse=False)
print(fastest_algo)  # Output: 'QuickSort', 'MergeSort', 'Timsort', or 'IntroSort'

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/skywalker94/skyshapython).

**Note** - As long as the library is in version `0.x.x` I am not actively looking after this. When I do intend to start managing and supporting this more seriously, I will upgrade to versions `1.0` and above. Thank you.

**Note** - To be fair I do not know how often I will check back with this library and look through suggested pull requests as so on.. At the time of writing this up I just wanted to make heaps easier for myself (I detest the heapq syntax. It feels like such a chore & I often forget it). In the future, I may add mode functionality to this and change my approach toward this tiny library. But until then.. godspeed!

Happy coding with **skyshapython**! ðŸŽ‰
